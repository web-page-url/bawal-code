Major Flaws:
No operator precedence handling - 2 + 3 * 4 will be evaluated left-to-right
No parentheses support for expressions
No type checking


Critical Security Flaw:
Apply to flaws.txt
case 'Declaration':
    return `let ${node.name} = ${node.value.map(v => v.type === 'string' ? `"${v.value}"` : v.value).join(' ')};`;
No input sanitization - vulnerable to code injection
Direct string concatenation for code generation is dangerous


MAJOR SECURITY VULNERABILITY:
Using eval() directly - extremely dangerous
No sandboxing - could execute any JavaScript code
No execution limits - could cause infinite loops


Issues:
Inline styles everywhere - maintainability nightmare
No proper error boundaries
No loading states during compilation


Language Features Analysis
What Works:
✅ Variable declarations (ye x = 5)
✅ Print statements (bol "Hello")
✅ User input (nivesh name)
✅ Basic conditionals (agar, warna)
✅ String concatenation
✅ Comments
What's Missing:
❌ Loops (for, while)
❌ Functions/procedures
❌ Arrays/lists
❌ Proper error handling
❌ Variable scoping
❌ Type system
❌ Import/export system


Critical Security & Performance Issues
Security (HIGH PRIORITY):
Code Injection: Direct eval() usage
XSS Vulnerability: No output sanitization
No Access Control: Can access browser APIs
Performance:
Memory Leaks: No cleanup of generated code
Infinite Loop Risk: No execution timeouts
Large File Handling: Will crash on big inputs


Architecture Recommendations
Separate Concerns: Split into Lexer, Parser, CodeGen, Runtime classes
Add Security: Implement proper sandboxing (Web Workers)
Improve Parser: Add operator precedence, better error recovery
Type System: Add basic type checking
Testing: Add comprehensive unit tests
Performance: Add execution limits and memory management



Verdict
This is an impressive educational project that demonstrates understanding of compiler theory. However, it has serious production issues:
⚠️ Security vulnerabilities make it unsafe for public use
⚠️ Code quality needs significant refactoring
✅ Good foundation for learning compiler concepts
✅ Nice UI/UX design
Overall Grade: C+ (Good concept, needs major improvements)
The code shows promise but requires substantial refactoring for production use. The Hindi keyword approach is innovative and could be valuable for educational purposes in Indian contexts.
